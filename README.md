📊 ConstructCo & SaleCo SQL Analysis Project

This project is part of my Data Science journey at Techma Zone, where I moved beyond basic CRUD operations and learned how real data analysts and data scientists work with relational data.
Using SQLite, I analyzed two business-style databases:

ConstructCo → Employee, project, job & assignment data

**SaleCo → Customers, invoices, products & sales data**

🚀 What This Project Includes
✅ Advanced SQL Querying

I worked with real-world SQL concepts used in data analytics, including:

JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Aggregations → SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG

Calculated / Derived columns

Data validation queries

WHERE, IN, HAVING filtering

Subqueries & CTEs

Financial & business-level analytics

📁 Key Tasks Solved

✔ Employee and project lookups
✔ Charge & cost calculations
✔ Project-wise and employee-wise summaries
✔ Invoice totals and customer purchase summaries
✔ Product-level reporting
✔ Inventory valuation
✔ Business-focused reporting directly from SQL

A total of 25 tasks were completed, each mimicking real company reporting.
