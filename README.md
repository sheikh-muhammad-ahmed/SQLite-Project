# **ConstructCo & SaleCo SQL Analysis Project**

**Advanced SQL Analytics on Real-World Business Databases**  
*Techma Zone Data Science Track – Relational Data Analysis Project*

This repository contains my complete solution to the **ConstructCo & SaleCo SQL Analysis Project**, where I went far beyond basic SELECT statements and worked like a real data analyst: translating business questions into efficient, readable, and accurate SQL queries.

I analyzed two realistic relational databases using **SQLite**:
- **ConstructCo** → Construction company with employees, projects, jobs, assignments, and hourly rates  
- **SaleCo** → Retail company with customers, products, invoices, invoice lines, and inventory data

Completed **25 real-world business reporting tasks** using production-level SQL techniques.
